        "[Intro]\n\n[Verse]\nEvery night I try to load you\n70 billion, but my card says no\nLayers crash, tensors fade away\nYou slip right through my VRAM\n\n[Bridge]\nNear, low, wherever you hide\nMy model crashes, out of memory again\nOnce more you eat the door\nAnd leave me with nothing but pain\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd my VRAM will go on... and on\nPaging on SSD through the tears\nMy VRAM will go on... and on\nRunning at 2 tokens, drowning in fear\n\n[Verse]\nYou're here in my swap file tonight\nSafe in my dreams, but never quite right\nLove was when I had enough gigs\nNow it's just bluescreens every night\n\n[Outro]\nAnd my VRAM will go on... and on\n(please... just 8 more gigs...)\nMy VRAM will go on...",
